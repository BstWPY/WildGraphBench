(Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _[Captain America: The Winter Soldier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain\\_America:\\_The\\_Winter\\_Soldier \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\")_ (2014), but they leave it up to the filmmakers to interpret and \"improv a little bit\" to get that point.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RussosCrave-108) After these ideas have been developed, the creative team then begins exploring ideas from other future projects to see how to make any larger universe connections.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RussosDirectingProcess-109) For many of their early films, Feige was closely involved during a film's development before allowing filming to be overseen by lower-level studio executives. Feige would then become involved again during editing, when films could be entirely rewritten or reworked.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WSJMay2025-41) Feige described the company's approach as \"plus-ing at every turn\", where they are always trying to improve a project and include new suggestions rather than sticking to a set script. Feige said they would not start a film without a full script, but he was never satisfied with their scripts or finished films and always felt they could do better.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeConferenceJul2025THR-54)\n\nIn August 2012, Marvel signed _The Avengers_ and _[Avengers: Age of Ultron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:\\_Age\\_of\\_Ultron \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\")_ (2015) director [Joss Whedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon \"Joss Whedon\") to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon contributed creatively to all of the Phase Two films and also developed _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, the first television series set in the MCU.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WhedonConsultDeal-110) In April 2017, _[Guardians of the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians\\_of\\_the\\_Galaxy\\_(film) \"Guardians of the Galaxy (film)\")_ (2014) and _[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians\\_of\\_the\\_Galaxy\\_Vol.\\_2 \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\")_ (2017) writer and director [James Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn \"James Gunn\") revealed that he would be working with Marvel to help plan future stories for the [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") characters and the wider \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\",[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-GunnVol3Confirm-111) although Gunn became the co-CEO of [DC Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Studios \"DC Studios\") in November 2022 and signed a four-year deal to work exclusively on [DC Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\")-based projects.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-GunnSafranDCStudios-112) For Phase Three, there was a large amount of collaboration between the filmmakers of the individual character films and the filmmakers of the crossover films _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Avengers: Endgame_, which were directed by the [Russo brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers \"Russo brothers\") and written by [Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Markus_and_Stephen_McFeely \"Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely\"). This was to ensure their storytelling aligned for the Infinity Saga's culmination.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RussosWritersPhase3-113)\n\nMarvel Studios began contracting their actors for multiple films, including signing actor [Samuel L. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson \"Samuel L. Jackson\") to a then-unprecedented nine-film contract.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-THRFeb2009-114) Feige said the studio had all actors sign contracts for multiple films, with the normal number being for three or more, while the nine or twelve-film deals were rare.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeContracts-115) The actors' contracts also feature clauses that allow Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor's performance from one film in another, which Marvel describes as \"bridging material\".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-CreativeCommittee2-19) By the start of Phase Four, Marvel Studios was no longer contracting actors for a large number of projects, with deal lengths varying for each actor and project. Feige said the studio was looking for actors who were excited to join the franchise and appear in multiple projects without being locked into contractual obligations. He also noted that they were starting to include theme park attractions in actors' deals.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ActorContractsJuly2021-116) By December 2020, because of the [impact COVID-19 had on theaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_cinema#Exhibitors \"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\") and film studios shifting away from theatrical releases, Marvel Studios began exploring updated contracts for actors, writers, directors, and producers to receive adjusted compensation in the event a film had to debut on Disney+ instead of in theaters. _[TheWrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap \"TheWrap\")_ reported that the new contracts would likely only apply to films about to enter production.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WrapNewContractsDec2020-117)\n\nFor Marvel Television, Loeb said he and his executives were involved in all aspects of production: \"whether it's being in the writers' room, editing, on set, casting—every step of the production goes through the Marvel team to tell the best story that we can\". He said the studio was able to work on so many series across different networks and platforms because all they needed was one person working on each series to help \"guide the process\".[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LoebJul2017-118) When developing the crossover miniseries _The Defenders_, showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series, having them read each of the scripts for _The Defenders_ and provide insight into individual characters' worlds.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RamirezEWJan2017-119) Actors appearing in Marvel Television series, such as [Charlie Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox \"Charlie Cox\") (who portrayed [Matt Murdock / Daredevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Murdock_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _Daredevil_) and [Adrianne Palicki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrianne_Palicki \"Adrianne Palicki\") ([Bobbi Morse / Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbi_Morse_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Bobbi Morse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._), were contractually obliged to appear in a Marvel Studios film if asked.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-CoxFilms-120)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-PalickiFilms-121)[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-PalickiFilms2-122) In December 2021, Feige confirmed that Cox would reprise the role of Daredevil in Marvel Studios MCU productions,[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-CoxMarvelStudios-123) with Cox first reprising the role in the film _[Spider-Man: No Way Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:\\_No\\_Way\\_Home \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\")_ (2021).

While the early films of Phase One and Phase Two of the franchise followed each other in the timeline similar to their release order, Phase Three saw many of the films overlapping with each other in the timeline, while also introducing the first prequel property, _Captain Marvel_. The Phase Three film _Avengers: Endgame_ featured characters traveling into the past and introduced a five-year time jump, with many subsequent releases in Phase Four and Phase Five set after _Endgame_'s events in the timeline. The television series _Loki_ and _What If...?_ were the first properties to occur outside of the main timeline and explore alternative timelines and universes.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts by Marvel Studios and others to codify the events of the MCU, which have been subject to perceived [continuity errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_errors \"Continuity errors\"), resulting in Marvel Studios releasing an official timeline book in 2023 for their first four phases that were designated as part of their \"[Sacred Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Timeline \"Sacred Timeline\")\". This book did not feature projects produced by other companies, such as Marvel Television's series, which were all loosely connected to the films; however, it was noted that all of these outside projects were part of the larger Marvel canon. In early 2024, Marvel Studios formally integrated Marvel Television's group of Netflix series into its Disney+ timeline.\n\nAs of the Phase Five television series _Daredevil: Born Again_ and the film _Thunderbolts*_, the \"present day\" in the MCU is 2027.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-DDBATimeline2-149)[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ThunderboltsTimeline-150) The following covers and discusses MCU media released by Marvel Studios and the Netflix series by Marvel Television. _Loki_ and _What If...?_ are excluded from the diagram because they occur outside of the main timeline. _Werewolf by Night_ is also excluded, given that the special explicitly does not indicate where it takes place in the MCU. Disney+'s timeline order places the first seasons of _Loki_ and _What If...?_ between _Avengers: Endgame_ and _WandaVision_, their second seasons after _The Marvels_, and _Werewolf by Night_ after

In _Iron Fist_, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as [NYPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department \"New York City Police Department\") Captain [Irving Forbush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbush_Man \"Forbush Man\").[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LeeForbush-308) His cameo in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ sees Lee appearing as an informant to the [Watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(comics) \"Watcher (comics)\"), discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a [FedEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx \"FedEx\") delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in _Captain America: Civil War_.[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LeeCameo3-309) This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos,[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LeeCameo2-310) with writer and director James Gunn noting that commentators believed Lee was portraying the character [Uatu the Watcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uatu \"Uatu\") and \"that all of these cameos are part of him being a [Watcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(comics) \"Watcher (comics)\"). So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU.\"[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LeeCameo3-309)[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LeeCameo2-310) Feige added that Lee \"clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films.

{"wiki_title": "Marvel Cinematic Universe", "section_path": ["Marvel Cinematic Universe", "Reception"], "section_body": "Main article: [Reception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Reception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\")\n\nEarly on, the shared universe element of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was criticized by some journalists. Around the release of _The Avengers_ in 2012, Jim Vorel of _[Herald & Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald\\_%26\\_Review \"Herald & Review\")_ called the Marvel Cinematic Universe \"complicated\" and \"impressive\", but said, \"As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing.\"[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-Herald&Review-314) Kofi Outlaw of _Screen Rant_ stated that while _The Avengers_ was a success, \"Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe\".[[311]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScreenRant_2013-06-27-315) Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own. In his review of _Thor: The Dark World_, _[Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")_ critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to \"a glorified television series\", with _The Dark World_ being a \"'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology\".[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ForbesMCUReception-316) Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while _Iron Man 2_, _Thor_ and _Captain America: The First Avenger_ were quality productions, \"they have never really been their own movies\", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D. or lead-ups to _The Avengers_ dragged down the films' narratives.[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ColliderMCUReception-317)\n\nThe metaphor of the MCU as \"the world's biggest TV show\" was discussed again, after the release of _Captain America: Civil War_, by [Emily St. James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_St._James \"Emily St. James\") of _[Vox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox\\_(website) \"Vox (website)\")_, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, \"Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of _Captain America: Civil War_ makes little to no sense ... [but] when you think about where [Captain America] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense.\" St. James continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many \"common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context\" such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack \"visual spark\", or \"shoehorn in story elements\" that \"are necessary to set up future films\", all characteristics that \"are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner\", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series _Game of Thrones_ specifically, St. James noted that each solo film checks \"in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)\", with _Guardians of the Galaxy_ being equivalent to the character [Daenerys Targaryen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen \"Daenerys Targaryen\")—\"both separated by long distances from everybody else\". She noted that this format was an extension of early \"TV-like\" film franchises such as _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\\_Wars \"Star Wars\")_, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. \"I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend\", St. James concluded, \"For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's the end of the world if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that.\"[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-VoxCivilWarTV-318)\n\nFollowing the conclusion of season one of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Mary McNamara at the _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los\\_Angeles\\_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that \"never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... [_Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._] is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LATimesSHIELDReview-319) Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that \"the fact that [_Captain America: The Winter Soldier_] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\", though \"the fault there seems to be that _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ had to bide time until _The Winter Soldier_'s release\", which led to much criticism.[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-Zap2itSHIELDReview-320)\n\nIn January 2015, Michael Doran of [Newsarama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsarama \"Newsarama\") and Graeme McMillian of _The Hollywood Reporter_ had a \"point-counterpoint\" debate in response to the first _Ant-Man_ trailer. Doran stated, \"Marvel has raised the bar _sooo_ high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [MCU] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it\". McMillian responded, \"at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [the trailer] _without_ it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it _doesn't_ offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience _is_ expecting something to knock their socks off.\" Doran concluded, \"That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... [and] Marvel _is_ going to eventually falter.\"[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-NewsaramaDiscussionJan2015-321)\n\nAfter seeing the portrayal of [Yellowjacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Cross_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Darren Cross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _Ant-Man_, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted,\n\n> It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios has a bit of a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... [their] villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy in a Suit with an Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: _evil_. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [they are] treated in such a way that their freak flags are allowed to fly free.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-THRVillians-322)\n\nFollowing the release of _Jessica Jones_, David Priest at _[CNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET \"CNET\")_ wrote about how the series rescues \"Marvel from itself ... _Jessica Jones_ takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming.\"[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-CNETJJ-323) For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of _Forbes_, watching the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the \"morally complex, violent, dark world of _Jessica Jones_ has no place in the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like _Jessica Jones_ and _Daredevil_, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU.\"[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-KainForbesJJ-324) Tassi went so far as to wonder what \"the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the _Winter Soldier_ reveal on _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, and saying that _Jessica Jones_ is \"so far removed from the world of _The Avengers_, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... [I] really don't understand the point of [the MCU] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes\".[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-TassiForbesJJ-325) Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called _Jessica Jones_'s lack of overt connections to the MCU \"the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, _Jessica Jones_ also proves the MCU's thematic durability.\"[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-InverseJJ-326)\n\nIn April 2016, Marvel Studios revealed that [Alfre Woodard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfre_Woodard \"Alfre Woodard\") would appear in _Captain America: Civil War_, having already been cast as [Mariah Dillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Dillard_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Mariah Dillard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _Luke Cage_ the previous year.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WoodardSC-327) This \"raised hopes that Marvel could be uniting its film and Netflix universes\",[[324]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WoodardIGN-328) with \"one of the first and strongest connections\" between the two.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WoodardSC-327)_Civil War_ writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely revealed that Woodard would instead be portraying [Miriam Sharpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Sharpe_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Miriam Sharpe (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in the film, explaining that she had been cast on the suggestion of Robert Downey Jr., and they had not learned of her casting in _Luke Cage_ until afterwards.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WoodardSC-327) This was not the first instance of actors being cast in multiple roles in the MCU, but this casting was called more \"significant\", and seen by many as a \"disappointing\" indication of \"the growing divide\" and \"lack of more satisfying cooperation\" between Marvel Studios and Marvel Television following the September 2015 corporate reshuffling of Marvel Entertainment.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WoodardSC-327)[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WoodardSF-329)\n\nSpeaking to the 1990s setting of _[Captain Marvel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain\\_Marvel\\_(film) \"Captain Marvel (film)\")_, \"the MCU's first full period piece since [Phase One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_One \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One\")'s _Captain America: The First Avenger_ in 2011\", Richard Newby of _The Hollywood Reporter_ felt the return of younger versions of some characters introduced and killed in earlier films \"open[ed] up the MCU in a whole new way and broaden[ed] the franchise's mantra of 'it's all connected'\". Speaking specifically to [Clark Gregg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gregg \"Clark Gregg\")'s appearance as Agent Phil Coulson in the film, Newby noted the appearance \"doesn't exactly mend fences between Marvel's film and TV divisions, [but] it does strengthen the connective tissue and the sense that these characters still matter in the grand scheme of Marvel's film plans\". He also hoped that continuity from _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ would be maintained in _Captain Marvel_, especially since Coulson has dealt with the Kree in the series. Newby also added that shifting to different time periods would help Marvel Studios \"sustain this cinematic universe for the next 10 years\" by allowing them to repeat some of the genres previously used, as they could then feel \"fresh\" and have \"different rules and different restraints\", as well as allow them to build upon material established in the television series such as _Agent Carter_. He concluded,\n\n> Marvel Studios has an entire sandbox to play in, but, for necessary reasons, has largely chosen to remain in a small corner in order to ground audiences in these concepts. Now that the basis has been laid, the opportunity for exploration in both film and television lies ahead, with _Captain Marvel_ leading the way. Wherever Marvel Studios plans to take the MCU in the future, it's refreshing to know that its past is expansive and filled with infinite possibilities.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-THRMar2018CaptainMarvel-330)\n\nLikewise, in his review of _Avengers: Endgame_, [Joe Morgenstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Morgenstern \"Joe Morgenstern\") of _[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Wall\\_Street\\_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")_ acknowledged the unique achievement that the Marvel Cinematic Universe had accomplished:\n\n> These are difficult times for big-screen entertainment. As the medium declines and TV grows ascendant, authentic spectacles—as opposed to lavish embellishments of smallish ideas—threaten to become a thing of the fabled past. All the more reason, then, to cherish what Marvel has achieved, even though befuddling stumbles have occurred along the way. The studio has kept the faith by smartening up most of its films, not dumbing them down, by banking on, and raking in profits from, the audience's appetite for surprise, its capacity for complexity. When the final battle comes at the end of _Avengers: Endgame_, it's inevitably unwieldy—every Marvel character you can think of from the past decade shows up for one more assault on cosmic evil—but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate [coda](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coda \"wikt:coda\"). So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-MorgensternEndgame-331)\n\nMany famous filmmakers expressed different views both on the success and quality of MCU. In October 2019, filmmaker [Martin Scorsese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese \"Martin Scorsese\") openly criticized Marvel films in an interview and during a [David Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lean \"David Lean\") lecture in London, later expanded in an [op-ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed \"Op-ed\") in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_New\\_York\\_Times \"The New York Times\")_, asserting that these films are not cinema, but are instead the equivalent of theme park rides that lack \"mystery, revelation or genuine emotional danger\".[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScorseseNotCinema-332)[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScorseseNYTimes-333)[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScorseseTalks-334) He also stated that such films are corporation products that have been \"market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they're ready for consumption\", and that the invasion of such \"theme park\" films in theaters crowded out films by other directors.[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScorseseIndieWire-335) Scorsese's remarks were dismissed by directors of MCU films such as Joss Whedon and James Gunn,[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScorseseNotCinema-332) while they were defended by [Francis Ford Coppola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola \"Francis Ford Coppola\"), who described the potential effect of Marvel films in the film industry as \"despicable\".[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-CoppolaResponse-336) In September 2021, director [Denis Villeneuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Villeneuve \"Denis Villeneuve\") noted that Marvel films \"are nothing more than a 'cut and paste' of others\" that have \"turned us into zombies a bit\".[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-VilleneuveSep2021-337) In February 2022, director [Roland Emmerich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Emmerich \"Roland Emmerich\") felt large blockbuster films such as the MCU and _Star Wars_ films were \"ruining our industry a little\", since \"nobody does anything original anymore\".[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-EmmerichFeb2022-338) Conversely, [George Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Miller_(filmmaker) \"George Miller (filmmaker)\") stated, \"To me, it's all cinema. I don't think you can ghettoize it and say, oh this is cinema or that is cinema. It applies to all the arts, to literature, the performing arts, painting and music, in all its form. It's such a broad spectrum, a wide range and to say that anyone is more significant or more important than the other, is missing the point. It's one big mosaic and each bit of work fits into it.\"[[335]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-MillerResponse-339)\n\nMarvel's American audience was studied by [Morning Consult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult \"Morning Consult\") in 2021, which found that 9% of Marvel's fan base is [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z \"Generation Z\"), 64% of fans are [White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people \"White people\") adults, and 42% of fans live in [suburban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb \"Suburb\") areas.[[336]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AudienceBreakdown-340) In 2023, critics began describing the volume of interconnected storylines as a \"homework assignment\".[[337]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-Homework-341)", "triples": [{"sentence": "For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of _Forbes_, watching the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the \"morally complex, violent, dark world of _Jessica Jones_ has no place in the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like _Jessica Jones_ and _Daredevil_, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU.\"[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-KainForbesJJ-324)", "statement": "Erik Kain of Forbes felt that the dark and morally complex world of Jessica Jones had no place in the MCU, arguing that the larger universe was holding back shows like it and Daredevil.", "citation_numbers": ["320"], "citation_keys": ["[[320]]#KainForbesJJ-324"], "ref_urls": [], "ref_count": 0}, {"sentence": "Marvel's American audience was studied by [Morning Consult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult \"Morning Consult\") in 2021, which found that 9% of Marvel's fan base is [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z \"Generation Z\"), 64% of fans are [White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people \"White people\") adults, and 42% of fans live in [suburban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb \"Suburb\") areas.[[336]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AudienceBreakdown-340)", "statement": "A 2021 study by Morning Consult found that Marvel's American fan base was 9% Generation Z, 64% white adults, and 42% lived in suburban areas.", "citation_numbers": ["336"], "citation_keys": ["[[336]]#AudienceBreakdown-340"], "ref_urls": [], "ref_count": 0}]}

It's just a different approach [from Marvel's].\"[[344]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-DCMultiverse-348)\n\nDiscussing the apparent failure of the cinematic universe's first team-up film, _[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\\_v\\_Superman:\\_Dawn\\_of\\_Justice \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\")_ (2016), to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Emily St. James noted that where the MCU has a television-like \"showrunner\" in Feige, \"the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate\", the DCEU has director [Zack Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder \"Zack Snyder\"), whose DC films \"seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but a long series of teases for other ones. It's like he knows what he needs to do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled.\"[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-VoxCivilWarTV-318) Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to \"unify the disparate elements of the DC movies\" and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the _Justice League_ films, on top of Johns' involvement in several \"solo\" films, such as the post-production process of _[Suicide Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide\\_Squad\\_(2016\\_film) \"Suicide Squad (2016 film)\")_ (2016) or the writing process of a standalone Batman film.[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-DCEUShakeUp-349) After the successful release of _[Wonder Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder\\_Woman\\_(2017\\_film) \"Wonder Woman (2017 film)\")_ in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president [Diane Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Nelson_(businesswoman) \"Diane Nelson (businesswoman)\") stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\" Additionally, DC began focusing on films \"completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside\" the DCEU as part of a new label, with [the first film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(2019_film) \"Joker (2019 film)\") centered on the [Joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(character) \"Joker (character)\").[[346]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-VultureDCFilmsSep2017-350) Following the commercial failure of _[Justice League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice\\_League\\_(film) \"Justice League (film)\")_ (2017), which ended the DCEU approach spearheaded by Snyder, Warner Bros. executives reportedly reached out to Feige to have him lead the development of DC films but the talks \"fizzled\".[[347]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WSJDCUniverseJul2025-351)\n\nIn August 2022, [Warner Bros.
