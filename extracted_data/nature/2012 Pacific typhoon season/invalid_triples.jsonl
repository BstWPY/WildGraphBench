Jelawat.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-327) By the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression.[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-328) On September 24, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, although deep convection was displaced to the south due to moderate vertical wind shear associated with Jelawat, leaving its low-level circulation center exposed.[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-329)[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-330) The center then began to consolidate, with deep convection wrapping over its eastern quadrant, prompting both the JMA and the JTWC to upgrade the system to a tropical storm, with the former naming it as _Ewiniar_.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-331)[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-332)\n\nMoving north-northeastward along the periphery of the subtropical ridge, Ewiniar's center continued to be displaced from the main convection due to moderate wind shear.[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-333) By September 26, Ewiniar struggled to maintain its deep convection due to the continued effects of wind shear.[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-334) Despite that, the JMA upgraded Ewiniar into a severe tropical storm.[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-335) On the next day, the system reached peak intensity as it turned northward, with weakening convection wrapping to its center,[[335]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-336) before it became embedded within a subtropical trough.[[336]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-337) However, deep convection wrapped the system as it became quasi-stationary late on the same day,[[337]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-338) before returning to a northeastward track soon after.[[338]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-339) By the next day, Ewiniar's center became partially exposed, and it began to weaken.[[339]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-340)[[340]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-341) On September 29, the JMA downgraded the system to a tropical storm, as convection was being displaced to the northeast of its center by strong vertical wind shear.[[341]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-342)[[342]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-343) The JTWC issued their final

upgraded it to a tropical depression.[[364]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-365) As the depression became quasi-stationary, deep convection consolidated over its center, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA by the next day.[[365]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-366) On October 1, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm, naming it as _Gaemi_.[[366]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-367) At the same time, the JTWC started issuing advisories on Gaemi as a tropical

Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hag%C3%A5t%C3%B1a,_Guam \"Hagåtña, Guam\").[[388]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-389) At the time, the depression had a consolidating low-level circulation center, and was under an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and marginal vertical wind shear.[[389]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-390) With increased central convection and improving but fragmented banding, the system continued to organize, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA late on the next day.[[390]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-391) On October 7, the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, and named it _Prapiroon_.[[391]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-392) At the same time, the JTWC started issuing advisories on Prapiroon as a tropical depression,[[392]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-393) before subsequently upgrading it to a tropical storm, noting its rapid improvement with deep convective banding wrapping from the southwest to the east of the system's center.[[393]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-394) Early by the next day, Prapiroon intensified to a severe tropical storm, as it continued to improve, with tightly-curved banding over its center, while moving westward along the subtropical ridge.[[394]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-395)[[395]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-396) The PAGASA later assigned the local name _Nina_ as the system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).[[396]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-397)\n\nLate on the same day, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, as deep convective banding was steadily developing along its southern quadrant.[[397]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-398)[[398]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-399) The JTWC subsequently followed suit by October 9, as an eye feature began to develop on satellite imagery.[[399]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-400) On the next day, Prapiroon further intensified into a category 2-equivalent typhoon.[[400]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-401) As it became quasi-stationary, due to a weak steering environment between the subtropical ridge to the northeast and a near-equatorial ridge to the southeast, Prapiroon developed an 18 nmi (33 km) eye,[[401]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-402) reaching its peak intensity as a category 3-equivalent typhoon late on October 11.[[402]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-IBTRACS_Prapiroon-403) By the next day, Prapiroon weakened to a category 2-equivalent typhoon, as its eye became ragged, along with warming cloud tops, while it was steered to the east-northeast by the near-equatorial ridge.[[402]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-IBTRACS_Prapiroon-403)[[403]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-404) On October 13, it further weakened to a category 1-equivalent typhoon due to [upwelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling \"Upwelling\"), as it slowed its northeastward movement.[[404]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-405)\n\nPrapiroon continued its slow track, as a subtropical ridge to the east began to take control of its steering environment as the near-equatorial ridge weakened, while its central convection decreased, before soon opening a 15 nmi (28 km) eye by the next day.[[405]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-406)[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-407) On October 15, the system reintensified to its secondary peak intensity, as deep convection wrapped its now-60 nmi (110 km) eye, while becoming quasi-stationary once again, entering a [col](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_(meteorology) \"Col (meteorology)\") area as nearby Severe Tropical Storm Maria tracked around the subtropical ridge.[[407]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-408)[[408]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-409) Prapiroon then started to weaken late on the same day, as deep convection decreased in its northeast quadrant, with warming cloud tops, while turning southwestward.[[409]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-410)[[410]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-411) As a result, the JMA downgraded the system to a severe tropical storm by the next day,[[411]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-412) with the JTWC following suit, due to a dry air intrusion in the system's structure, as it started to recurve westwards.[[412]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-413)[[413]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-414) Prapiroon then returned to a northeastward track, cresting the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, while its center became fully exposed as cold air from the [East China Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Sea \"East China Sea\") advected into the system.[[414]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-415) The storm later exited the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing their final advisory.[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-416) As it started to accelerate on October 18, its deep convection diminished, while dry air surrounded its center, along with increasing wind shear as an upper-level trough created strong [subsidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence_(atmosphere) \"Subsidence (atmosphere)\") along the western side of its center.[[416]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-417) Prapiroon soon became embedded in a [baroclinic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroclinic_zone \"Baroclinic zone\") of strong wind shear, as the system's structure began to be elongated, with its deep convection unraveling and sheared to the north of its center.[[417]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-418)[[418]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-419) It began its extratropical

west.[[419]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-420)[[420]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-421) Prapiroon fully transitioned to a

October 12, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about 400 km (250 mi) to the northeast of Guam.[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-Maria_BT-422) At the time, the system's convection was sheared to the southwest of its ill-defined & partially exposed low-level circulation center, and was under a low to moderate wind shear environment.[[422]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-423) As deep convection started to build over its center, the JTWC issued a TCFA early on October 14.[[423]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-424) Six hours later, the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, naming it as _Maria_.[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-Maria_BT-422)[[424]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-425) At the same time, the JTWC started issuing advisories on Maria as a tropical depression,[[425]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-426) before subsequently upgrading it to a tropical storm, as convection continued to deepen.[[426]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-427)\n\nMoving northwestward along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, the JMA reported that Maria intensified into a severe tropical storm early by the next day.[[427]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-428)[[428]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-429) However, its deep convection became slightly displaced to the south, due to increasing wind shear.[[429]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-430) It soon wrapped into its center again, as wind shear decreased;[[430]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-431) however, the JMA downgraded Maria to a tropical storm by October 16.[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-Maria_BT-422) Maria then reached peak intensity, with an eye feature seen in microwave imagery.[[431]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-432) This became short-lived, as its deep convection began to be sheared to the east of the system due to increasing westerly flow aloft associated with a subtropical [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream \"Jet stream\").[[432]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-433) By the next day, Maria's convection became displaced to the northeast of its center due to moderate to strong wind shear, as it accelerated northeastward.[[433]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-434) It soon recovered by early October 18, with centralized convection persisting over its center, but it was being impacted by mid-latitude flow around the subtropical ridge.[[434]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-435) However, 12 hours later, strong wind shear significantly sheared the system, exposing its center.[[435]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-436) By the next day, both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Maria to a tropical depression, with the former issuing their final advisory, as the system's center was becoming elongated.[[436]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-437)[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-438) The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on Maria as well.[[438]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-439) The remnants remained traceable until early on October 20, when the JMA reported
