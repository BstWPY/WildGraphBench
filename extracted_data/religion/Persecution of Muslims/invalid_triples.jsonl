Some were killed, such as [Sumayya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumayya \"Sumayya\"), the seventh convert to Islam, who was allegedly tortured first by [Amr ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_ibn_Hisham \"Amr ibn Hisham\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-1) Even the [Islamic prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_prophet \"Islamic prophet\")[Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_in_Islam \"Muhammad in Islam\") was subjected to such abuse; while he was praying near the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba \"Kaaba\"), [Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uqba_ibn_Abu_Mu%27ayt \"Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt\") threw the [entrails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrail \"Entrail\") of a sacrificed camel over him. Abu Lahab's wife [Umm Jamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Jamil \"Umm Jamil\") would regularly dump filth outside his door and placed thorns in the path to his house.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-2)[_[unreliable source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable\\_sources \"Wikipedia:Reliable sources\")_]\n\nAccordingly, if free Muslims were attacked, slaves who converted were subjected to far worse.

The [Fatimid Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate \"Fatimid Caliphate\"), [Al Hakim of Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hakim_bi-Amr_Allah \"Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah\"), known as the \"mad Caliph\"[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-4) destroyed the [Constantinian-era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great \"Constantine the Great\")[Church of the Holy Sepulcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulcher \"Church of the Holy Sepulcher\") in 1009, as well as [other Christian churches and shrines in the Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_desecration_of_Jerusalem \"Fatimid desecration of Jerusalem\").\n\nThis event, in conjunction with the [killing of Germanic pilgrims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_German_Pilgrimage_of_1064%E2%80%9365 \"Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–65\") who were travelling from Byzantium to Jerusalem, raised the anger of Europe, and inspired Pope Urban II to call on all Catholic rulers, [knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight \"Knight\"), and noblemen to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule.\n\nIn part, it was also a response to the [Investiture Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_Controversy \"Investiture Controversy\"), which was the most significant [conflict between secular and religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state_(medieval) \"Separation of church and state (medieval)\") powers in [medieval Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe \"Medieval Europe\"). The controversy began as a dispute between the [Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Holy Roman Emperor\") and the [Gregorian Papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII \"Pope Gregory VII\") and gave rise to the political concept of [Christendom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom \"Christendom\") as a union of all peoples and sovereigns under the direction of the pope; as both sides tried to marshal public opinion in their favour, people became personally engaged in a dramatic religious controversy. Also of great significance in launching the crusade were the string of victories by the Seljuk Turks, which saw the end of Arab rule in Jerusalem.\n\n[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Taking_of_Jerusalem_by_the_Crusaders%2C_15th_July_1099.jpg/250px-Taking_of_Jerusalem_by_the_Crusaders%2C_15th_July_1099.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taking_of_Jerusalem_by_the_Crusaders,_15th_July_1099.jpg)\n\nCapture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099\n\nOn 7 May 1099 the Crusaders reached [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\"), which had been recaptured from the [Seljuks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuks \"Seljuks\") by the [Fatimids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid \"Fatimid\") of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the Crusaders were able to end the siege by breaking down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over the course of that afternoon, evening, and next morning, the Crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem, Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the [Temple Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount \"Temple Mount\") inside the [Al-Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibli_Mosque \"Qibli Mosque\"), the Crusaders spared few lives.

Another tax on levied them for a time was the _augustale_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-10) Muslim rebellion broke out during the reign of [Tancred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancred,_King_of_Sicily \"Tancred, King of Sicily\") as [King of Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Sicily \"King of Sicily\"). Lombard pogroms against Muslims started in the 1160s. Muslim and Christian communities in Sicily became increasingly geographically separated. The island's Muslim communities were mainly isolated beyond an internal frontier which divided the south-western half of the island from the Christian north-east. Sicilian Muslims were dependent on royal protection. When [King William the Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_Sicily \"William II of Sicily\") died in 1189, this royal protection was lifted, and the door was opened for widespread attacks against the island's Muslims. Tolerance towards Muslims ended with increasing Hohenstaufen control. Many oppressive measures, passed by [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor\"), were introduced in order to please the Popes to stop Islam from being practised in [Christendom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom \"Christendom\"): the result was in a rebellion of Sicily's Muslims. This triggered organized and systematic reprisals which marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The rebellion abated, but direct papal pressure induced Frederick to mass transfer all his Muslim subjects deep into the Italian hinterland.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-autogenerated2-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-14)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\\_sources#Bundling\\_citations \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] In 1224, [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor\") expelled all Muslims from the island transferring many to Lucera (_Lugêrah_, as it was known in Arabic) over the next two decades. In this controlled environment they could not challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called _Lucaera Saracenorum_ because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. During peacetime, Muslims in Lucera were predominantly farmers. They grew [durum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durum \"Durum\") wheat, [barley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley \"Barley\"), [legumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume \"Legume\"), grapes, and other fruits. Muslims also kept bees for [honey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey \"Honey\").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-15) The [Muslim settlement of Lucera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_settlement_of_Lucera \"Muslim settlement of Lucera\") was destroyed by [Charles II of Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Naples \"Charles II of Naples\") with backing from the papacy. The Muslims were either massacred, forcibly converted, enslaved, or exiled. Their abandoned mosques were demolished, and churches were usually built in their place.

The Muslims were granted amnesty and allowed to live as long as they stayed outside the city.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-98) Some of the Muslims who fought, like General Dong, did not do it because they were Muslim, rather, like many other generals, they gathered bands of followers and fought at will.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-99)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-100)\n\n[![Image 20: Street demonstration with banners, passing an official building](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Uyghur_protest_Berlin%2C_July_2009_3.jpg/250px-Uyghur_protest_Berlin%2C_July_2009_3.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uyghur_protest_Berlin,_July_2009_3.jpg)\n\nDemonstration in Berlin for Uyghur human rights\n\nZuo Zongtang generally massacred New Teaching Jahriyya rebels, even if they surrendered, but spared Old Teaching Khafiya and Sunni Gedimu rebels. Ma Hualong belonged to the New Teaching school of thought, and Zuo executed him, while Hui generals belonging to the Old Teaching clique such as Ma Qianling, Ma Zhan'ao, and Ma Anliang were granted amnesty and even promoted in the Qing military. Moreover, an army of Han Chinese rebels led by [Dong Fuxiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fuxiang \"Dong Fuxiang\") surrendered and joined Zuo Zongtang.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Garnaut-101) General Zuo accepted the surrender of Hui people belonging to the Old Teaching school, provided they surrendered large amounts of military equipment and supplies, and accepted relocation. He refused to accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who still believed in its tenets, since the Qing classified them as a dangerous heterodox cult, similar to the [White Lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus_Societies \"White Lotus Societies\") Buddhists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-102)\n\nThe Qing authorities decreed that the Hui rebels who had taken part in violent attacks were merely heretics and not representative of the entire Hui population, just as the heretical White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-103) Qing authorities decreed that there were two different Muslim sects, the \"old\" religion and \"new\" religion. The new were heretics and deviated from Islam in the same way that the White Lotus deviated from Buddhism and Daoism, and stated its intention to inform the Hui community that it was aware that the original Islamic religion was one united sect before the advent of new \"heretics\", saying they would separate Muslim rebels by which sect they belonged to.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-104) Zuo also stated that he would accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who admitted that they were deceived, radicalized, and misled by its doctrines. Zuo excluded khalifas and mullas from the surrender.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-105)\n\nDuring the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution \"Cultural Revolution\"), mosques along with other religious buildings were often defaced, destroyed, or closed and copies of the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran \"Quran\") were destroyed and cemeteries by the [Red Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_(China) \"Red Guards (China)\").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-106) During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding \"superstitious beliefs\" and promoting \"[anti-socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-socialist \"Anti-socialist\") trends\".[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-107) The government began to relax its policies toward Muslims in 1978, and supported worship and rituals.

There has been an upsurge in Islamic expression and many nationwide Islamic associations have been organized to co-ordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-109)\n\nHowever, restrictions have been imposed on Uyghur Islamic practices because the Chinese government has attempted to link Islamic beliefs with terrorist activities since 2001. Numerous events have led the Chinese government to crack down on most displays of Islamic piety among Uyghurs, including the wearing of veils and long beards. The [Ghulja Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulja_Incident \"Ghulja Incident\") and the [July 2009 Ürümqi riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_riots \"July 2009 Ürümqi riots\") were both caused by abusive treatment of Uyghur Muslims within Chinese society, and they resulted in even more extreme government crackdowns. While Hui Muslims are seen as being relatively docile, Uyghurs are stereotyped as [Islamists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism \"Islamism\") and punished more severely for crimes than Hui are. In 1989, China's government banned a book which was titled _Xing Fengsu_ (\"Sexual Customs\") and placed its authors under arrest after Uyghurs and Hui Muslims protested against its publication in

During the reign of [Anna of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_of_Russia \"Anna of Russia\"), many Muslims were forced or pressured to convert.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:13-242) New converts were exempted from paying taxes, were granted certain privileges, and were given better resources for the learning of their new faith.

The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighbouring [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\"). The explicit Russian goal was to expel the groups in question from their lands.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-247) They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire or in Russia far from their old lands.

Similar events as these occurred elsewhere during the Greek Revolution resulting in the eradication and expulsion of virtually the entire Turkish population of the [Morea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morea \"Morea\"). These acts ensured the ethnic homogenization of the area under the rule of the future modern Greek state.[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-319) According to claims by Turkish delegations, in 1878 the Muslim inhabitants in [Thessaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaly \"Thessaly\") are estimated to be 150,000 and in 1897 the Muslims numbered 50,000 in Crete. By 1919 there were virtually no Muslims left in Thessaly and only 20,000 in Crete.[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-320)\n\nIn the [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarians \"Bulgarians\") insurgency of the [April Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Uprising \"April Uprising\") in 1876 an estimate of 1,000 Muslims were killed.[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-321)[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-322) During the [Russo-Turkish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%931878) \"Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)\") large numbers of Turks were either killed, perished, or became refugees.

It is estimated that 220,000 [Pomaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomaks \"Pomaks\") were forcefully [Christianized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianized \"Christianized\") and forbidden to wear Islamic religious clothing.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-330)\n\nDuring [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the [Chetniks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetniks \"Chetniks\"), a Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist movement, committed numerous [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetnik_war_crimes_in_World_War_II \"Chetnik war crimes in World War II\") primarily directed against the non-Serb population of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia explicitly ordering the ethnic cleansing, mainly 29,000–33,000 Muslims were killed.[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-331)[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-332)\n\nAlso during World War II, Muslims faced sporadic but significant and violent persecution at the hands of the Croatian fascist [Ustaše](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e \"Ustaše\") movement in the [Independent State of Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_State_of_Croatia \"Independent State of Croatia\"). Despite Ustaše overtures and positive propaganda towards Muslims, the government in Zagreb in reality staunchly favored Catholics in the military, government and ministry positions, with Muslim militias being regarded as little more than cannon fodder with little to no combat effectiveness. Catholics held the vast majority of high ranking government offices, leading to complaints and protests from Muslim religious leaders. The archbishop of Sarajevo had stated that the situation had become critical for Muslims due to violent persecution from both the Serbian Chetniks and Croatian fascists. According to some reports, as many as 100,000 Muslims had been killed and 250,000 displaced by the Ustaše by 1943. There were also reports of forced conversions of Muslims to Catholicism.

Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship. There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain.[[462]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-462) People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice.[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-463)\n\nThe reason for having Tajikistan in this article is primarily because the government of the country itself, is – or is seen to be – the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In fact, the government – with the apparent approval of the people – is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n\n*   The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   There are some restrictions, and the Government monitors the activities of religious institutions to keep them from becoming overtly political.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   Religious communities must be registered by the Committee on Religious Affairs, which monitors the activities of Muslim groups[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   The official reason given to justify registration is to ensure that religious groups act in accordance with the law but in practice it ensures they do not become overly political.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   President Imomali Rahmonov strongly defended \"secularism\", likely understood both by the President and his audience, as being \"antireligious\" rather than \"nonreligious.\"[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   The vast majority of citizens, including members of the Government, consider themselves Muslims and are not anti-Islamic but there is a pervasive fear of Islamic fundamentalism in both the government and much of the population at large.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   A 1998 law prohibits the creation of political parties with a religious orientation.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   A November 2015 rule reportedly bans Government Employees from attending Friday Prayers.[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-465)[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-eurasianet1-466)\n*   The Friday \"Government Employee Prayer ban\" appears to relate to leaving work during normal working hours to attend prayers. \"Over the last two weeks, after Idi Qurbon, our management forbade us from leaving work to attend Friday prayers,\" one unnamed government employee told Asia-Plus.[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-eurasianet1-466)\n\nMosques are not permitted to allow women inside due to a fatwa issued in August 2004, by the Tajik Council of Ulema, or scholars – the country's highest Muslim body.[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-467) Part of the reasoning for this is that Tajikistan has 3,980 mosques, but very few are designed to allow men and women to worship separately, a practice Islam generally requires. The fatwa was not strictly enforced and more recently, it has been reported that the Ulema Council will relax the ban.[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-468)\n\nOnly state controlled religious education is approved for children and long beards are banned in Tajikistan.[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-469)\n\nIn Tajikistan, Mosques are banned from allowing Friday Prayers for children younger than 18 year old.[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-470)[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-471)[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-472)[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-473)[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-474)\n\nFrom the beginning of 2011, 1,500 mosques were shut down by the Tajik government, in addition to banning the hijab for children, banning the use of loudspeakers for the call of prayer, forbidding mosques from allowing women to enter, and monitoring Imams and students learning an Islamic education abroad, having sermons in the Mosque approved by the government and limiting the Mosque sermons to 15 minutes.[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-475) Muslims experienced the most negative effects from the \"Religion Law\" enacted by the government of Tajikistan, curtailing sermons by Imams during weddings, making the \"Cathedral mosques\" the only legal place for sermons to be given by Imams with sermons not being allowed in five-fold mosques, the five-fold mosques are small mosques and serve a limited number of people while the medium and big mosques are categorized as Cathedral mosques, girls who wore the hijab have been expelled from schools and hijabs and beards are not permitted on passport photos.[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-476) Mosques have been demolished and shut down by the Tajikistan government on the justification that they were not registered and therefore not considered as mosques by the government.[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-477)[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-478)\n\nTajikistan has targeted religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Christians, and Muslims who try to evade control by the government, synagogue, churches, and Mosques have been shut down and destroyed, only a certain amount of mosques are allowed to operate and the state must approve all \"religious activity\", in which younger than 18-year-old children are not allowed to join in.[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-479) Buildings for religious worship for Jehovah's Witnesses, Protestant Churches, the Jewish Synagogue, and Muslim mosques have been targeted, destroyed, and shut down and prayers are forbidden to take place in public halls, with severed restrictions placed on religion.[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-480) Churches, a synagogue, and mosques have been destroyed by the Tajikistan government.[[481]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-481)\n\nGovernment approval is required for Tajiks seeking to engage in religious studies in foreign countries and religious activities of Muslims in particular are subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government.[[482]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-482) State control has been implemented on Islamic madrasahs, Imams, and Mosques by Tajikistan.[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-483) A list of sermon \"topics\" for Imams has been created by the Tajikistan government.[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-484) Towns are only allowed to have a certain number of mosques and only religious buildings sanctioned by the government are allowed to host religious activities, schools have banned hijab, religious studies in private have been forbidden mosque religious services are not allowed to admit children and non-registered mosques have been closed.[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-House2014-485)[[486]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-486)[[487]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-487) Religious matters are banned for children under 18 year old.
